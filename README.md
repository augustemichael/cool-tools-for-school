# Cool Tools for School

This project was created for Lesson 2: Building a Webpage Template.  
It uses basic HTML to structure a simple website and includes a link to a sitemap page.

## Project Overview
The Cool Tools for School website provides an example of how to organize study tools and resources using HTML.  
It shows how to use headings, paragraphs, lists, and links to build a simple webpage layout.

## Designing Webpages with CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to design and format webpages.  
While HTML controls the structure of a page, CSS controls how it looks â€” including colors, fonts, spacing, and alignment.  
In this project, CSS is used in a simple way to make the text readable, add spacing, and keep the layout clean and organized.

## Built With
- HTML5 for structure  
- Basic inline CSS for appearance
