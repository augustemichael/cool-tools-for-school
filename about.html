      <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        This website was created to demonstrate a simple, clean layout for a basic multi-page project.
        It focuses on readability, structure, and clear navigation, providing a foundation that can be
        expanded with custom content and styles.

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        The site consists of three main pages — Home, About, and Contact — along with a sitemap to
        show the overall structure. Each page follows a consistent design so users can move between
        sections easily. This kind of structure is perfect for personal websites, portfolios, or small projects.

      <h2>Future Plans</h2>
      <p>
        Future updates may include adding responsive layouts, improved visuals, and interactive
        components to enhance usability and design flexibility. This site serves as a foundation to build on.
